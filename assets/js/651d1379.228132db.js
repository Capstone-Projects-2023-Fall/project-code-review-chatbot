Her primary objectives are to learn essential programming skills effectively, improve her coding proficiency, and do so efficiently. Sarah values resources that provide clear explanations, practical examples, and constructive feedback to help her understand and correct her mistakes. Balancing academic commitments with personal coding projects, Sarah seeks tools that optimize her learning process, making the most of her limited study time. She is motivated by her passion for coding and is excited about the prospect of mastering programming to contribute to innovative tech projects. In her tech stack, Sarah predominantly uses Visual Studio Code for coding projects and is comfortable with languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java.
