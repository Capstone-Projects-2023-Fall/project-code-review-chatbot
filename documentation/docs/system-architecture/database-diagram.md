The following figure shows the entity relationship and table design of the database for the server. Users will be stored in the Users table using a unique identifier from GitHub. This will require the user to be signed into GitHub to use the extension. Whenever a user receives a suggestion, an entry will be made in the Repositories table to identify the repository the user is working on (if there is one). The suggestion will be stored in the Suggestions table along with the path of the file being reviewed, the Repository ID, and the line number. The repository ID will be a nullable field since it will not be required to have a repository linked for reviews. All other fields will be required.
