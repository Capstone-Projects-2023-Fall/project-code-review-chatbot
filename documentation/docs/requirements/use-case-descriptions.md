### User Persona Google Developer

  As a developer using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), I aim to streamline my coding experience by integrating ChatGPT into my coding environment. With this integration, I hope to gain real-time code assistance, generate code snippets, and enhance my overall coding efficiency. The integration should allow me to easily set up ChatGPT within VSCode and trigger it with a keyboard shortcut or a command from the VSCode command palette. I want ChatGPT to provide contextual assistance, enabling me to ask questions or request coding help related to my ongoing coding tasks. It should generate relevant code snippets, offer debugging suggestions, and provide explanations of coding concepts. The ability to understand natural language queries is crucial, making it user-friendly for developers of all skill levels. Customization options for preferred programming languages and coding styles should be available. Ultimately, the integration should boost my productivity by reducing the time spent on coding challenges and debugging, and it should support collaboration by allowing me to share ChatGPT-generated code or insights with my development team during code reviews and discussions.
