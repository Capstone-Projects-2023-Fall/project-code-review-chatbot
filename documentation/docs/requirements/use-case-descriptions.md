2. CodeReview finds ways to improve readability to professional standards
3. CodeReview sends suggestions to the user.
4. User makes changes and takes note of the suggestions so they can not make these mistakes later
5. User now has a way to make a database of making and maintaining clean code

### **Case 3:**
Sarah a computer science student who loves to code but has difficulties writing efficient and organized code.
1. Sarah downloads and installs the ChatGPT Code Review Extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace. The installation is quick and seamless.
2. With her assignment code open in Visual Studio Code, Sarah activates the ChatGPT extension by clicking the chat icon in the sidebar. She submits her code for review, specifying the programming language she's using and attaching a brief description of the assignment's requirements.
3. ChatGPT quickly analyzes her code and provides feedback within seconds. It highlights potential issues, such as inefficient algorithms, naming conventions, and code readability problems.
4. Sarah engages in an interactive discussion with ChatGPT. She asks specific questions about the highlighted issues to gain a deeper understanding of the recommendations. ChatGPT responds with clear explanations, examples, and links to relevant documentation.
5. Using the guidance from ChatGPT, Sarah makes iterative improvements to her code. She receives real-time feedback as she implements changes, ensuring she's on the right track.
6. After several rounds of interaction and code improvements, Sarah is satisfied with her code's quality. She submits her assignment, confident that it meets the required standards.

### **Case 4:**
User is a casual coder who is trying to learn and make fun little projects on their own time. They feel like they don't have enough time to properly learn everything there is about coding standards. While working on a pet project they become stuck and download the CodeReviewChatbot extension in hopes of it helping them solve their issues.
1. User finds errors in running their code
2. User searches online for a quick fix, but is having trouble  finding a simple fix
3. User is prompted by extension if they need help
4. User agrees, and is prompted with a potential fix
5. Extension infroms user of the syntax error and how to solve it

5. Bob now feels confident in pushing his work

### **Case 6:**
Anna is someone who codes all their work within one main function on one program. While there is no inherent problem with this for the work she is currently undergoing, eventually she will have to learn that this is notthe most optimal way of coding. Enter CodeReviewChatbot to help her.
1. Anna works on code for a couple hours and decides to commit her work
2. CodeReviewChatbot catches the commit process, and sends anna feedback
3. Specifically, CodeReviewChatbot informs anna of code that she has repeated throughout her program
4. Then CodeReviewChatbot suggests making some functions
5. Anna implements this, making her code shorter, more concise, and overall less repetitive

### **Case 7:**
Nai is someone very intruiged by AI. Nai also codes and researches the CodeReviewChatbot extension. Wanting to see how AI would rate their work and suggest fixes, they download the extension. From here Nai goes on a rabbithole of talking to CodeReviewChatbot about their work.
1. Nai writes a couple of comments into pre-existing code to have a commit
2. CodeReviewChatbot catches the commit process, and sends Nai feedback on their work
3. The commit is halted and Nai wants further explanations of the feedback
4. CodeReviewChatbot further explains the suggestions made
5. Nai now asks again where the suggestions are coming from and if they are alternatives
6. CodeReviewChatbot answers the additional questions and gives Nai more information
