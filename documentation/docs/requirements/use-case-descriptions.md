5. Bob now feels confident in pushing his work

### **Case 6:**
Anna is someone who codes all their work within one main function on one program. While there is no inherent problem with this for the work she is currently undergoing, eventually she will have to learn that this is notthe most optimal way of coding. Enter CodeReviewChatbot to help her.
1. Anna works on code for a couple hours and decides to commit her work
2. CodeReviewChatbot catches the commit process, and sends anna feedback
3. Specifically, CodeReviewChatbot informs anna of code that she has repeated throughout her program
4. Then CodeReviewChatbot suggests making some functions
5. Anna implements this, making her code shorter, more concise, and overall less repetitive

### **Case 7:**
Nai is someone very intruiged by AI. Nai also codes and researches the CodeReviewChatbot extension. Wanting to see how AI would rate their work and suggest fixes, they download the extension. From here Nai goes on a rabbithole of talking to CodeReviewChatbot about their work.
1. Nai writes a couple of comments into pre-existing code to have a commit
2. CodeReviewChatbot catches the commit process, and sends Nai feedback on their work

=======
User Persona Google Developer
  As a developer using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), I aim to streamline my coding experience by integrating ChatGPT into my coding environment. With this integration, I hope to gain real-time code assistance, generate code snippets, and enhance my overall coding efficiency. The integration should allow me to easily set up ChatGPT within VSCode and trigger it with a keyboard shortcut or a command from the VSCode command palette. I want ChatGPT to provide contextual assistance, enabling me to ask questions or request coding help related to my ongoing coding tasks. It should generate relevant code snippets, offer debugging suggestions, and provide explanations of coding concepts. The ability to understand natural language queries is crucial, making it user-friendly for developers of all skill levels. Customization options for preferred programming languages and coding styles should be available. Ultimately, the integration should boost my productivity by reducing the time spent on coding challenges and debugging, and it should support collaboration by allowing me to share ChatGPT-generated code or insights with my development team during code reviews and discussions.
