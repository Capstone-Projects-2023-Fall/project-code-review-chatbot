## Version Control Tool
  The tool of choice for us is Git, first, all the team members have worked with GIt before on their own project. Second, this is an efficient tool for managing our development process, it is easy to see which one of our team members did what at which time. This is a reliable tool for the job, as one of the industry standard tools this is more than capable of tracking our dates of files and updates. 

## Procedures 
  Our team's process of development is simple and efficient. Everything usually starts with Jira, Once a member is delegated a task from Jira, they create a new branch to work on that specific task. As soon as the member has done that task, they would submit a pull request and communicate to the team that they had done this task. Then the team member who has not worked on the branch would come to Github and review the changes that they made then we would leave a comment to approve or give feedback on where they need to work on more. Once it is approved the branch would be merged into the main branch which is where the baseline of our code is.
