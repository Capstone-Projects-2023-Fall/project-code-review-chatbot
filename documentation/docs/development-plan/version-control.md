  The tool of choice for us is Git. First, all of the team members have worked with Git before on their own projects. Second, this is an efficient tool for managing our development process as it is easy to see which one of our team members contributed work and when the work was completed.  As one of the industry standard tools, Git is more than capable of tracking our files and updates.

# Process of Getting updates
  Our team's process of development is simple and efficient. Everything starts with a member being delegated a task from Jira, they then create a new branch on Git to work on that specific task. As soon as the member has done that task, they will submit a pull request and communicate to the team that they have done this task. Then the team member who has not worked on the branch will come to Github to review the changes that they made. Then the reviewer will give feedback on what they need to work on more or approve the pull request. Once it is approved, the branch will be merged into the main branch which is where the baseline of our code is.
