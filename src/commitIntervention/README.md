## Git Commit Intervention Setup

To Setup commit intervention with the extension our "pre-commit" script can be used.

### Usage

1. Copy the "pre-commit" file from the "src" directory to the ".git/hooks/" directory of your Git repository.

2. Make the script executable by running the following command in your repository's root directory: "chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit"
